# Software

This is a list of the software tools that I have developed together with various collaborators. 

## NeuralNets

NeuralNets is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based utility library designed to quickly prototype with deep learning models for image segmentation of volumetric datasets. It offers data preprocessing and GPU accelerated augmentation, 2D/3D U-Net training and finetuning, block-based segmentation of large-scale volumes, segmentation visualization, etc.

## DenoisEM

DenoisEM is a GPU accelerated, interactive ImageJ plugin that allows for fast and advanced image denoising of large-scale 3D datasets. It offers state-of-the-art algorithms, user-interactive parameter optimization, fast denoising of large-scale volumes and scalable and reproducible processing. DenoisEM is a collaborative project between the [Saeys lab](https://vib.be/labs/yvan-saeys-lab) and [Bioinformatics Core](https://vib.be/labs/vib-bioinformatics-core) at VIB and the [IPI](https://ipi.ugent.be/) research group.
