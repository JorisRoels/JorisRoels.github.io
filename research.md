# Research

I develop machine learning methods to solve the many challenges that come along with biomedical image analysis. The sections below provide an overview of the fields where I have contributed. 

## Image segmentation
Image segmentation is the fundamental task of assigning class labels to each pixel in the image.

## Domain adaptation
In domain adaptation, we consider a (relatively large) labeled source dataset and a target dataset with no or very few label. The goal is to maximize the predictive performance on the target dataset based on all the available labels. 

## Active learning
In active learning situations, we assume the availability of an oracle that can provide labeled data. In each iteration, a set of samples is selected and queried to the oracle, after which the predictor is retrained. The goal is to achieve maximum predictive performance with as few queried samples as possible. 

## Image restoration
Image restoration aims at improving the quality of the images by removing noise, blur, etc. This can improve performance of automated analysis techniques in subsequent steps.
