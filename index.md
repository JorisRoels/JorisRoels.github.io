## About me

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Master's degree in Mathematical Computer Science in 2012 and 2014, respectively, at Ghent University. I pursued a PhD at the IPI research group at Ghent University and the DAMBI research group at VIB and obtained my degree in 2019. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at VIB. 

- On the research side, I develop machine learning techniques that can automate the biological image analysis pipeline. ([Read more](research))
- I develop software solutions for biomedical problems with a focus towards ease of usage. ([Read more](software))
- Lastly, I also provide guidance to a broad audience to efficiently use these tools. ([Read more](workshops))
